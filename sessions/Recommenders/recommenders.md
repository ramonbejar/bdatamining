In these two notebooks, we cover the topic of algorithms for recommender systems, from two different points of view:

1. In the first notebook (5-latentfactors-recommenders) we consider the approach of building recommendations using the whole information contained in the user-product matrix, where the entries in the matrix denote ratings (or simply items bought by costumers) of products by users. Empty entries in the matrix indicate products not bought by the users. We follow a collaborative (global filtering) approach, where the information from ALL the users that bough a given product is used to infer new probably interesting products for users that did not buy that product.  
The most basic algorithms for this approach are based on finding a UxV  matrix decomposition of the user-product matrix. The decomposition finds a set of "latent factors" that characterize users and products as vectors of basic features.

2. The second notebook (6-Item-to-items-globalfiltering-recommenders) follows also a global filtering
approach, but considers algorithms that are more appropriate for user-item matrices that are very, very sparse, in the sense that the typical number of products bought by an user is typically much more smaller than the total number of products. The approach is based on comparing directly pairs of products with similarity measures to define how interesting they can be for a same user. Then, once we compute the item-to-item similarity values for all our products, we can produce recommendations of new products for any NEW user that enters to the shop, once he makes at least one purchase or browses at least one product he seems to be interested in. As a concrete algorithm, we present the basic recommender system that was originally developed by Amazon to make recomendations in a very efficient way based on this item-to-item approach. It is a VERY, VERY interesting algorithm (even if you do not mind about marketing as it is my case...).
