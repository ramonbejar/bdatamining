    "In this notebook, we consider the problem of mining frequent itemsets when the input is a collection of transactions, where a transaction is again an itemset. The frequent itemsets we want to mine from the transactions will be subsets of these transactions, and so we are interested in discovering the most frequent subsets in such transactions. We are going to present two widely used algorithms: the *A-Priori algorithm* and the *FP-Growth algorithm*. The last one is implemented in the machine learning library of spark. In this notebook we talk about the problem, the A-Priori Algorithm and association rules. The second algorithm is presented in a next notebook."
