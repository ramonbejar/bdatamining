Data mining: mining frequent itemsets


### Previous year


Hi All,

Today we will learn how to mine frequent item sets from lists of sets. If we consider each set as a set of items bought together  in a transaction in a shop, this mining operation can show us what are the most frequently bought together products to help us in marketing operations. We will discuss the simple A-priori algorithm, and also the more efficient FP-growth algorithm. This information is very valuable for traditional and on-line shops, but of course, finding frequent item sets can be useful also in other domains not related to shops.

### This year (2018-2019)

Hi All,

Tomorrow we will learn how to mine frequent item sets from lists of sets. If we consider each set as a set of items bought together  in a transaction in a shop, this mining operation can show us what are the most frequently bought together products to help us in marketing operations. We will discuss the simple A-priori algorithm, and also the more efficient FP-growth algorithm. This information is very valuable for traditional and on-line shops, but of course, finding frequent item sets can be useful also in other domains not related to shops.  You will have to work on a small exercise, that will be the base for one of the two  exercises that will be evaluated in this second part of the course. So, I recommend to attend to this class if you do not want to have problems to work in the first exercise.
